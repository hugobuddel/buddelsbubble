## Mythbusting at home: Phone Chargers

One of my goals is to live in an environment friendly way. Like, following advice on saving energy. But the advice has to make sense of course!

A tip that you often find in magazines etc. is that phone chargers consume too much energy to keep them plugged in all the time. Like this message in Dutch:

![Opladers vreten energie, laat ze dan ook niet in het stopcontact zitten als je ze niet gebruikt](../../images/klimaattips-punt3.jpg)

But is this actually true? Let's find out!

Recently, I've bought an electricity meter and decided to put this claim to the test.
Plugged in were 3 old (3.7V) Nokia charges, 2 New (5V) nokia charges, 1 old Sony Ericson charger, and a mini-usb charger, without devices attached.
An ASUS eee-pc charger was added for good meassure.
And the result is... just a single Watt!

However, two larger transformers and two battery charges do use about 8 Watt together:

Conclusion: don't worry about phone charges, but do check other transformers.
